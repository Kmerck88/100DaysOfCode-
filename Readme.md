 The int type represents an integer, a zero, positive, or negative whole number. You use the + symbol for addition. Other common mathematical operations for integers include:

- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division


You've seen one of the fundamental math operations with integers. The int type represents an integer, a zero, positive, or negative whole number. You use the + symbol for addition. Other common mathematical operations for integers include:


Explore order of operations
  The C# language defines the precedence of different mathematics operations with rules consistent with the rules you learned in mathematics. Multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction. 

You can force a different order of operation by adding parentheses around the operation or operations you want performed first
   d = (a + b) * c;
Console.WriteLine(d);

Explore more by combining many different operations
  d = (a + b) - 6 * c + (12 * 4) / 3 + 12;
Console.WriteLine(d);"# 100DaysOfCode-"
